      <p>Have you ever hit "Reply All" and instantly regretted it? You're not alone. While it might seem harmless, replying to everyone can clutter inboxes and confuse your coworkers.</p>
<p><strong>Try this instead:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Only reply to the sender unless multiple people genuinely need the update.</li>
  <li>If your reply includes private or sensitive information, double-check the recipient list.</li>
</ul>
<p>One small change in your habits can make communication smoother across your whole team!</p>
